These are a series of JavaScript exercises intended to be used alongside the curriculum at 'The Odin Project'. They start simple and easy but get more complex and involved as you progress through them.

Each exercise involves writing the body of a function such as it passes the tests
defined in the spec file. The series uses Jest as Javascript testing framework.

This repo will serve as a hub for my attempted solutions to the exercise as well as a checklist for my progress through the assignments.
